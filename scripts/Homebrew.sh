You will then see a screen that     details what can be installed. If it says that BootMii can only be installed as an IOS, that's normal. Also, keep in mind that you can't install BootMii on a Wii Mini  without hardware mods, as it requires an SD card.

Select Continue. Then select 'Install Homebrew Channel'. Select Continue, wait, then select back, and select 'Install BootMii as IOS'. If you can't install BootMii at  this moment, but want to install it later (or uninstall something), run HackWiiAgain.sh in the HackWii folder, then the scripts folder.

Select Continue, wait, then select 'Install BootMii as boot2' if you can. If the option is not available, select Exit, and it should take you to the homebrew channel."
